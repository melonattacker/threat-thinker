| ID | Severity | Title | Why | Affected | STRIDE | References | Evidence | Score |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TTP01 | High | PII Exposure in Database Communication | PII is transmitted over TCP with unspecified encryption, risking data leakage or modification in transit. | ECS Service (Fargate), Aurora (RDS) | Information Disclosure, Tampering | ASVS V9.1.1, ASVS V10.2.1, CWE-319 | ecs_service_fargate, aurora_rds, ecs_service_fargate->aurora_rds | 8 |
| TTP02 | High | Unencrypted Traffic Between Load Balancer and ECS Service | HTTP (not HTTPS) is used between the load balancer and ECS, risking PII/internal data exposure or tampering. | Application Load Balancer, ECS Service (Fargate) | Information Disclosure, Tampering | ASVS V9.1.1, ASVS V10.2.1, CWE-319 | application_load_balancer, ecs_service_fargate, application_load_balancer->ecs_service_fargate | 8 |
| TTP03 | High | Potential Lack of End-to-End Authentication | No authentication is specified between the load balancer and ECS, risking unauthorized access to internal services. | Application Load Balancer, ECS Service (Fargate) | Spoofing, Elevation of Privilege | ASVS V2.1.1, ASVS V2.2.2, CWE-287 | application_load_balancer, ecs_service_fargate, application_load_balancer->ecs_service_fargate | 7 |
| TTP04 | Medium | Credential Exposure from User to CloudFront | User credentials are transmitted; if HTTPS is misconfigured, credentials could be intercepted or replayed. | User, CloudFront | Information Disclosure, Spoofing | ASVS V2.1.1, ASVS V9.1.1, CWE-522 | user, cloudfront, user->cloudfront | 6 |
| TTP05 | Medium | Insufficient Access Controls on S3 Bucket (Assets) | Internal data in S3 may be accessible if bucket policies are overly permissive or misconfigured. | ECS Service (Fargate), S3 Bucket (assets) | Information Disclosure, Elevation of Privilege | ASVS V4.1.3, ASVS V1.4.3, CWE-284 | ecs_service_fargate, s3_bucket_assets, ecs_service_fargate->s3_bucket_assets | 6 |
| TTP06 | Medium | Denial of Service via Unrestricted Queue/Event Injection | If access controls are weak, attackers could flood queues or events, exhausting Lambda or backend resources. | SQS Queue (jobs), SNS Topic (events), Lambda Worker | Denial of Service | ASVS V7.5.1, ASVS V10.4.3, CWE-400 | sqs_queue_jobs, sns_topic_events, lambda_worker, sqs_queue_jobs->lambda_worker, sns_topic_events->lambda_worker | 5 |
| TTP07 | Medium | Lack of Message Integrity in SQS/SNS Communications | No evidence of message signing or integrity checks, risking message tampering or spoofing in internal queues. | ECS Service (Fargate), SQS Queue (jobs), SNS Topic (events), Lambda Worker | Tampering, Repudiation | ASVS V10.4.1, ASVS V10.4.2, CWE-345 | ecs_service_fargate, sqs_queue_jobs, sns_topic_events, lambda_worker, ecs_service_fargate->sqs_queue_jobs, sns_topic_events->lambda_worker | 5 |
| TTP08 | Medium | Potential Over-Privileged Lambda Worker | Lambda may have excessive permissions to SQS/SNS or other AWS resources, increasing lateral movement risk. | Lambda Worker | Elevation of Privilege, Tampering | ASVS V1.4.2, ASVS V4.2.1, CWE-250 | lambda_worker, sqs_queue_jobs->lambda_worker, sns_topic_events->lambda_worker | 5 |
| TTP09 | Medium | Insufficient Audit Logging for Sensitive Operations | No evidence of audit logging for access to PII or internal data, hindering incident response and accountability. | ECS Service (Fargate), Aurora (RDS), S3 Bucket (assets) | Repudiation | ASVS V10.1.1, ASVS V10.2.1, CWE-778 | ecs_service_fargate, aurora_rds, s3_bucket_assets, ecs_service_fargate->aurora_rds, ecs_service_fargate->s3_bucket_assets | 4 |
| TTP10 | Medium | Potential Data Leakage via Misconfigured CloudFront | CloudFront may expose sensitive headers or cache private data if not properly configured. | CloudFront | Information Disclosure | ASVS V9.1.1, ASVS V14.4.1, CWE-200 | cloudfront, user->cloudfront, cloudfront->application_load_balancer | 4 |
