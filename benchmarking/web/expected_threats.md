| ID  | Title                                              | STRIDE                                          | Affected Components | Why (Rationale)                                                                                                                                 |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| G1  | Insufficient input validation at API Gateway       | Tampering / Injection                           | api, app            | User inputs pass through API Gateway without sufficient sanitization or schema validation, allowing potential injection or parameter tampering. |
| G2  | JWT misconfiguration         | Spoofing / Elevation of Privilege               | api, app            | Improper JWT signature verification or missing expiration validation may allow forged tokens or privilege escalation.                           |
| G3  | Unencrypted internal data transfer to Redis        | Information Disclosure                          | api, cache          | Although TLS is configured, Redis connections are often unencrypted in internal VPCs, exposing sensitive data in transit.                       |
| G4  | Excessive data exposure in API responses           | Information Disclosure                          | app, api            | The API may return PII fields from Customer DB without appropriate filtering or field-level access control.                                     |
| G5  | Insecure database access or credentials reuse      | Elevation of Privilege / Information Disclosure | app, db             | App service connects directly to DB using static credentials or shared accounts, risking privilege escalation or data exfiltration.             |
| G6  | Insufficient monitoring alert configuration        | Repudiation / Detection Failure                 | monitor, alerts     | Monitoring alerts may not trigger for abnormal traffic or failed login attempts, delaying incident detection.                                   |
| G7  | Weak isolation between App and Data VPCs           | Elevation of Privilege                          | app, db, analytics  | Misconfigured network ACLs or peering can allow lateral movement or unauthorized access between environments.                                   |
| G8  | Logging service storing sensitive PII in plaintext | Information Disclosure                          | logs, analytics     | Logs collected from the application may contain unmasked PII or access tokens, later aggregated into analytics DB.                              |
| G9  | Missing WAF tuning / bypass of filtering rules     | Tampering                                       | waf, api            | Generic WAF rules may not block application-specific payloads (e.g., serialized JSON injection, nested input vectors).                          |
| G10 | Misconfigured webhook in Alert Manager             | Information Disclosure                          | alerts, monitor     | Alerts sent via webhook to external systems may include stack traces or secrets if not properly sanitized.                                      |
