| ID  | Title                                              | STRIDE                               | Affected Components | Why (Rationale)                                                                                                    |

| G1  | Public S3 Bucket Exposure                          | Information Disclosure               | s3                  | Misconfigured S3 bucket permissions may allow public access to sensitive logs or uploaded data.                    |
| G2  | Insufficient TLS Enforcement Between ALB and ECS   | Information Disclosure               | alb, ecs            | ALB–ECS communication over HTTP (not HTTPS) can expose session tokens or PII to interception inside the VPC.       |
| G3  | Overprivileged IAM Role on ECS Tasks               | Elevation of Privilege               | ecs                 | ECS task roles often have wildcard permissions (`*:*`), enabling attackers to access unrelated AWS resources.      |
| G4  | Unvalidated Input Leading to SQL Injection in RDS  | Tampering / Information Disclosure   | ecs, rds            | If application input is not properly sanitized, SQL queries may be manipulated, leaking or altering customer data. |
| G5  | SNS / SQS Message Tampering or Replay              | Tampering / Denial of Service        | sqs, sns, lambda    | Without message signing or idempotency checks, attackers could replay or modify messages between components.       |
| G6  | Sensitive Data in CloudWatch or S3 Logs            | Information Disclosure               | s3, ecs             | Application or infrastructure logs stored in S3 or CloudWatch may include PII or access tokens without masking.    |
| G7  | Misconfigured Lambda Trigger Permissions           | Elevation of Privilege               | lambda, sns, sqs    | Lambda triggered from SQS/SNS may have overly broad execution roles or unverified event sources.                   |
| G8  | Lack of WAF Rule Tuning / Bypass of CDN Protection | Tampering                            | cf, alb             | Generic WAF/CDN configurations may fail to block application-specific injection or path traversal patterns.        |
| G9  | Missing Backup Encryption for RDS Snapshots        | Information Disclosure               | rds                 | Automated backups or snapshots may not be encrypted, exposing PII if snapshots are shared or leaked.               |
| G10 | Unmonitored Cross-Region Data Transfer             | Repudiation / Information Disclosure | ecs, s3             | Data replicated across regions (S3 replication, logging) may bypass compliance boundaries without visibility.      |
